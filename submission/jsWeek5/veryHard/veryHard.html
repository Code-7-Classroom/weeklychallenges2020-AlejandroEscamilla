<!-- // VERY HARD: Write a function that takes in a string and outputs the
 *first* occurrence of a character that does not repeat itself 

// in that string. Output the first character in a string that is unique.
// Input: “the quick brown fox jumps over the calm kitten quietly”  Output: “b”
// Input: “this hat is the greatest!”  Output: “g”
// Input: “what a wonderful day it has been!”  Output: “o” -->
