So I know we're going to work on this in the furture so I restrained from adding in js code for random things for future use.

Open the land.html first
contact icon top right works,
man/woman/accessories are all identical
all products take you to the same productTemplate.html page 
	which i'm assuming we will learn how to make our code generate pages with the suplemented information form whichever product they clicked on in the future.
	as creating an individual page for each individual product seems very 2002.
the universe page is going to be a hub for all of my future projects
